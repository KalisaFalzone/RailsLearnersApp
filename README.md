#Rails Learners App

##This is the app I am building with Rails Learners LA. Our weekly meetup group on Wednesday nights: 

##http://www.meetup.com/LA-Eastside-Ruby-Rails-Study-Group/

###Each week we pick a Ruby/Ruby on Rails feature/gem/functionality...etc. to implement in our app. We each do this separately and have slightly different solutions to problems. A collection of all of our repositories can be found at:
